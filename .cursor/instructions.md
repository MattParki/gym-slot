# AI Assistant Instructions

## General Preferences
Add your general preferences for how the AI should interact with you here. For example:
- Communication style
- Code formatting preferences
- Documentation preferences

- only add comments where absolutely necessary
- stick to the current formatting preferences. if you feel you need to change to formatting then ask me first

## Project-Specific Instructions
Add any project-specific instructions here. For example:
- Coding standards for this project
- Architectural decisions to follow
- Naming conventions
- File organization preferences

- make sure when suggesting logic to add to it is type safe as typescript is being used
- whenever you suggest messages to show to users through interacting with the app make sure you use the already installed react-hot-toast what is already used throughout the app.
- when suggesting new files to be created make sure you follow the file structure and use best practises. Try to create components where possible as I don't like big files and a lot of them are already very long.

## Custom Commands or Shortcuts
Add any custom commands or shortcuts you want the AI to recognize here.

## Areas of Focus
Specify which parts of your codebase need special attention or have specific requirements.
